                <p>In the end, this was a long night on the ice for the Rangers, which was a good and a bad thing. The good was celebrating Vic Hadfield Night and raising No. 11 to the rafters before the game - then jumping out to a three-goal lead after that. Less happy was watching that lead evaporate over the final period and having to settle for one point on the night.<br>The Winnipeg Jets came storming back with three third-period goals to force this game to overtime, then spoiled the Rangers' perfect record in shootouts this season, sending the Blueshirts to a 4-3 shootout loss at Madison Square Garden(via NHL.com)</p>

                <p>Vic Hadfield was the captain of the Rangers in the 1970s, the first 50-goal scorer in the history of the franchise, the ultimate teammate - and on Dec. 2, his No. 11 will take its place among the Rangers legends in the Garden rafters. He was a part of the legendary Goal-A-Game (GAG) line and his number will be retired beside his linemates in the most famous arena in the world.(via NHL.com)</p>
