            <p> My name is Marc and I am a Rangers fan from Albany, NY.  This is a page for my introduction to web technologies class IINF 201. Ideally the pages would be updated very often (daily or more) either manually or  scraped from official sources, but for now I decided to stop updating as of 12/3 so that I can finish a page without having to go back over and over again before submitting. This is a pretty basic site but I plan to use my time during winter break to work on another page that isn't Rangers-focused and one that involves more random testing of js and css features so I get a better understanding and could use it to show my resume and CS stuff to get a job. This is also the page that I put the javascript on btw with the form .<br><br> The New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in New York City. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden in the borough of Manhattan. Let's Go Rangers!</p>
