            <h3>Rangers Take Point in Shootout Loss to Jets</h3>
            <p>In the end, this was a long night on the ice for the Rangers, which was a good and a bad thing. The good was celebrating Vic Hadfield Night and raising No. 11 to the rafters before the game - then jumping out to a three-goal lead after that. Less happy was watching that lead evaporate over the final period and having to settle for one point on the night. The Winnipeg Jets came storming back with three third-period goals to force this game to overtime, then spoiled the Rangers' perfect record in shootouts this season, sending the Blueshirts to a 4-3 shootout loss at Madison Square Garden. Mark Scheifele, Jack Roslovic and Bryan Little each scored in the final frame for the Jets, who outshot the Rangers 42-19 and improved to 2-0 on their three-game NYC-area trip. "That's one heck of a hockey team," David Quinn said afterward. "Probably the best team we've seen all year." The Rangers added another home-ice point to their ledger but lost for the fifth time in six games (1-4-1), and now will have five days of rest and practice before resuming their schedule on Saturday night against the Panthers in Florida.</p>
